# Medical-insurance-cost-prediction-Mechine-learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical insurance premiums based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the insurance cost for an individual using different supervised learning algorithms.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, region).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distribution and identifying correlations between features and the target variable (insurance premium).
Model Selection: Implementing and comparing multiple models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Neural Networks
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Analyzing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Datasets:
The dataset used in this project includes common features related to personal and health factors influencing insurance premiums. It is either sourced from public datasets (e.g., Kaggle) or generated synthetically for the purpose of training and testing the model.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, etc.
How to Run:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
https://github.com/777santosh/Medical-insurance-cost-prediction-Mechine-learning.git

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook insurance_premium_prediction.ipynb
Evaluate and visualize the model's predictions on the test set.

Future Enhancements:
Incorporating more advanced models or deep learning techniques.
Adding support for more complex health-related features.
Deploying the model via a web application or API.
